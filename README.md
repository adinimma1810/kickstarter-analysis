## Overview of the Project
  This project describes about different release that occured in various countries within a time period. It also show that the releases are successful or failure or canceled or went live. It describes the goal for the releases and how much the releases earned(pledged) and how many members have invested(backers_count) in the releases.
## Challenges
  As a begineer my first challenge is formulas. They play a major role in learning excel. I got the grip on the formulas by praticing them and understand what they will do.
## Conclusions
  ### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
    The graph theater_outcomes_vs_launch_date tells that which is the best month in the year for the theater catecory to be released. Coming to plays subcategory it shows that which month gets the most success in the time period.
  ### Outcomes based on goals
    This chart shows at what goal range there is more chance of success and at what goal range there is more chance of failure.
